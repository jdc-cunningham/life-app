# Progress

### 09-11-2019
not much today, just integrated the calorie counter app into the fitness "sub-app" <br>
one issue on the mind which I will have to address is the deprecation of componentWillMount... I tried to just stick the init state code somewhere <br>
but it wasn't working right... I mean I'm using a state object and also trying to use a constructor <br>
I will need to address this with the integration of IndexedDB. I'm hesitant to make much progress with anything that saves <br>
until I get IndexedDB in. <br>
Also I am aware of the date, moment of silence
